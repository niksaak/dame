Distance And Modular Entities
TODO file.

2013-07-05 [ ] XXX: i have to conclude which is better for entity types to use
                    â€” draw() functions or Drawing structs.
                    First option seems to be more flexible for individual
                    entities while the other one can more or less guarantee
                    consistency of drawing methods.

2013-06-07 [ ] TODO: create basic game entities, with support for drawing,
                physicsing and docking

2013-06-05 [x] TODO: write function with prototype
                int draw_vects(cpVect vects[], DrawMode mode, size_t count),
                drawing array of `count` vects in desired mode.
