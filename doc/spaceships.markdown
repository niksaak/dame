## This is a game about SPACEships

### Ship
Player ship is a conglomerate of **modules**, each with its' own purpose and
requirements.

### Module
Modules themselves can vary by their size, each successive being two times
larger than previous. Each module contains the **facility**, which defines what
module can do, and four **ports** through which facility can interact with
surrounding world.

### Facility
Facility defines capabilities of the module. It can be *reactor*, *engine*,
*fuel tank*, *control core* or something with even cooler name. Big modules
can contain more than one smaller facility, but not all of them are compatible.

### Port
Ports are the means for facility to interact with outside world. The most
common and basic kinds of port are:
+ **Docking port**: Allows for two modules to be reversibly connected
  with each other.
+ **Nozzle**: Allows engine modules to provide thrust.
+ **Shunting system**: Set of smaller nozzles providing attitude control.
+ **Armor plating**. Improves module hardiness.
