## Particles

Any particle in DAME can be in one of three states:
  + **HOT** particles are energetic, fast, harmful and short-lived
  + **WARM** particles are not that scary but still do have high energy level
    and live a little longer
  + **COLD** particles are almost immortal and can stick to each other to 
  form chunks of matter *(TODO)*
